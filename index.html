      <p>Welcome to my personal website! My name is Shana and I am a rising sophomore in high school. I’m very interested in computer science and engineering with great hopes of pursuing a career in those fields. <br><br>It's crazy what you can learn in one year. I like math and sometimes, I like english too. I love learning and genuinely hope it'll make a positive difference in this world.</br></br></p>
